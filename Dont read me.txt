I am learning python and this is one of my first "projects".
I used pygame, code that is write is not very nice and not
in english but it is working. Not sure if you can understand
the code but you should be able to understand the game.
This is stil work in proggres there is a lot to do to finish it.

And all characters look the same but have diffrent properties.
